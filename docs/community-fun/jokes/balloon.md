A man flying a hot air balloon makes an emergency landing in a field. He calls out to a passerby, “can you tell me where I am?”. The passerby responds, “you are in a balloon in the middle of a field.” To this the man says “you must be an accountant. The information you gave me is totally accurate but utterly useless.” The passerby then retorts, “and you must be a CEO. You’re steering a craft over which you have no control and you want me to tell you where you are going.”
