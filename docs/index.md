# ERP Reimagined Knowledge

Use this space to capture **Tips & Tricks**, **Problem Reports**, **Suggestions**, and **Corrections** as the team learns.

## How to add a new item

Use the helper script from the project root (in a terminal):

```bash
./new_entry.sh
```

You can run it with no arguments and answer the prompts, or pass type + title directly:

```bash
./new_entry.sh tip "Quick vendor filter"
./new_entry.sh problem "Bank recon button missing"
./new_entry.sh suggestion "Add aging shortcut"
./new_entry.sh correction "Typo in invoice template"
```

Then refresh the site in your browser.
